#SQL SCRIPTS FOR DATA CLEANING

##Let’s filter out invalid or weird trips:

SELECT
  payment_type,
  trip_distance,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE) AS trip_duration_min,
  EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime) AS day_of_week,
  passenger_count,
  fare_amount
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022`
WHERE
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount > 0
  AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE) BETWEEN 1 AND 240


##Find out: Do card users take longer or shorter rides?  [LONGER]
SELECT
  payment_type,
  COUNT(*) AS total_trips,
  AVG(trip_distance) AS avg_distance,
  AVG(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE)) AS avg_duration_min
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022`
WHERE
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount > 0
  AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE) BETWEEN 1 AND 240
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY total_trips DESC;


##Do cash users ride more on weekends?    [NO]
SELECT
  payment_type,
  EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime) AS day_of_week,
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022`
WHERE
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount > 0
  AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE) BETWEEN 1 AND 240
GROUP BY payment_type, day_of_week
ORDER BY payment_type, day_of_week;



##Average Fare by Payment Type      [CASH AND CARD HAS ALOMOST EQUAL]
SELECT
  payment_type,
  ROUND(AVG(fare_amount), 2) AS avg_fare
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022`
WHERE
  fare_amount > 0
GROUP BY payment_type;
